# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

<a href="https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/an-alliance-python-and-r-eda-9336e66fc65c">Exploratory Data Analysis</a> (EDA) is used when you need a quick approach to go through a data set to discover the variables and acquire insights.
With the help of descriptive statistics and visualizations, exploratory data analysis focuses primarily on the ability to perform initial investigations 
on data to detect patterns, identify problem areas, test hypotheses, and validate assumptions. It can be a bit overwhelming when you encounter a small-large dataset
and EDA helps you to quickly surf through the data, giving you an actual insight that can help you decide on how you want the data to be transformed for analysis.
